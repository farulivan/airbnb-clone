        description: "First, I will meet you at central Jakarta and provide a quick overview of the experience, you'll have not only native Indonesian-Jakarta but also English speakers. And then we will visit old town side of Jakarta, so you can visit some of our historical and unique places such as Fatahillah (Kota Tua/Old town), Chinatown/pecinan market, Pasar Baru, or the old harbor. Then I would love to show you the best and legendary street food in near Central Jakarta. Since we are trying to get you to some places, we will also provide you transport (with Transjakarta/Public Bus or online taxi if necessary) to go to those places and see many Jakarta street. Lastly, I also hope to share with you Jakarta and Indonesia culture by showing you where people usually gather at Central Jakarta. After that, I'll directly drop you off at the place we met or to your hotel (if nearby).",

        description: "G'day there, My name is Trent & I have created a really chilled Blue Mountains experience for those seeking a social & less touristic tour with full transport. After picking you up from Sydney in our mini bus, we will drive to my hometown of Glenbrook to grab a coffee together at a cool local cafe. Before we show you some kangaroos & kookuburras in the bush. We will take you on a moderate 90min bushwalk via some amazing view points, small waterfalls to the base of a big waterfall into Jamison Valley. Unless you are a big hiker this is more than enough. We provide a social picnic lunch where we all connect & byo beers/drinks are fine. We actually stop by an alcohol shop in the bus. After lunch we stop by the famous Three Sisters Rock formations up at Katoomba. We also stop at Lincols rock (Google it). On the warmer days we go for a quick dip in a local swimming spot deep in the bush (Nov-March). Our adventure generally concludes 530ish near central station at the front of a bar/cafe (often some in the group grab a drink together).",
